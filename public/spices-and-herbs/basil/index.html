        <p>Basil is an herb that is characterized by its sweet, slightly peppery flavor. It is often used in Italian dishes, such as pasta sauces and pizzas. It can also be used in salads, soups, and stir-fries. It can also be used to make pesto, a sauce made from basil, pine nuts, garlic, and olive oil.</p>
