        <p>Spices and herbs are not only used for flavor enhancement but also offer numerous health benefits. Many spices, such as turmeric, ginger, and garlic, have anti-inflammatory properties and are rich in antioxidants. Herbs like basil, parsley, and cilantro provide essential vitamins and minerals while adding negligible calories to your meals. Including a variety of spices and herbs in your diet can help boost your immune system and improve overall health.</p>
