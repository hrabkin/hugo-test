Fruits and fruit juices are rich in essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Whole fruits provide fiber, which aids in digestion and helps regulate blood sugar levels. Fruit juices, while nutritious, can be high in natural sugars and lack the fiber found in whole fruits. Consuming a variety of fruits, such as berries, citrus, and apples, can enhance your diet with essential nutrients like vitamin C, potassium, and folate.
